# Project Dashboard

# Milestone 1
### Volttron reads data from simulated and real sensors
- [ ] Identify viable sensor and sensor interface
- [ ] Run through Volttron example agents and lightly modify them 
- [ ] Create sample Vottron datapublisher (fake/mock device) for subscriber 
- [ ] Create sample Volttron subscriber/listener agent
- [ ] Mock sensor input in Volttron
- [ ] Refactor pub/sub samples for realistic sensor data
- [ ] Unit test sensor input
- [ ] Unit test pub/sub flow 
- [ ] Procure real sensor for trial
- [ ] Create functional test for real sensor and pub/sub agents

# Milestone 2
### Data is stored, analyzed, and reported
- [ ] Create schema for raw and aggregate sensor data
- [ ] Define key reporting metrics
- [ ] Create Volttron historian agent for MySQL database
- [ ] Create web API endpoint for pub/sub sensor data (callable from outside volttron)
- [ ] Setup remote replication of database

# Milestone 3
### Full prototype works and passes tests
- [ ] Build functional tests for data pipeline
- [ ] Build performance/stress test for data pipeline

# Milestone 4
### Data is used to generate decisions and control fan

# Milestone 5
### Prototype is deployed on site and passes tests
