# Project Dashboard

## Milestone 1
### Volttron reads data from simulated and real sensors
- [ ] Identify viable sensor and sensor interface
- [ ] Something NOT finished
- [ ] Create sample Volttron subscriber/listener agent
- [ ] Create sample Vottron datapublisher (fake/mock device) for subscriber 
- [ ] Create sample Vottron datapublisher (fake/mock device) for subscriber 
- [ ] Refactor pub/sub samples for sensor output 

## Milestone 2
### Data is stored, analyzed, and reported
- [ ] Create web API endpoint for pub/sub sensor data (callable from outside volttron)
- [ ] Setup remote replication of database

## Milestone 3
### Full prototype working with passing tests
- [ ] Build functional tests for data pipeline
- [ ] Build performance/stress test for data pipeline

## Milestone 4
### Deploy the prototype on site and pass all the tests
