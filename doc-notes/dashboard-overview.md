# Dashboard Overview
Information and format of the dashboard. 
>TODO: Consider using Volttron Central. However it is beta and has limited customization.

---
CATEGORIES OF DATA
---

- Measurement data is divided into three time bins: Current, Last 24 hours, and Historical. If the dashboard page is open, it will update the current data every 90 seconds. Data for the last 24 hours updates every 60 minutes.

- Each set of measurement data has summary statistics, including a range, averages, totals, etc.
>TODO: Can we calculate statistics via a database trigger?

- Status data reports on the activity of devices and the system overall.

- Logs are copied and read from the system.
>TODO: Currently no description of code to do this. We need the volttron log, plus an error log.

-------------------------
GUI ELEMENTS
-------------------------
The dashboard is based on text, but includes simple graphical elements.

####Graphs
>TODO: Need a charting library

####Gauges
>TODO: Consider an animated gauge, something like http://justgage.com/

####Customizable Grid Layout
>TODO: Consider a flexible grid layout that allows resizing (e.g. https://github.com/hootsuite/grid). 
This would allow an "everything" dashboard page.
