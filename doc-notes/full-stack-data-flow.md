# Full Stack Data Flow

The system moves data from devices (from sensors and the fan) through volttron and reports via a user dashboard.

The system has four main loops:
1. Every 60 seconds Volttron checks the status of all system components ("status loop")
2. Every 5 minutes Volttron stores sensor and fan data ("sampling loop")
3. Every 10 minutes, Volttron runs an aggregate-analyze-decide-control ("decision loop")
4. Every 60 minutes, Volttron runs external data collection (weather, pricing, etc.) ("accessory data loop") 

And one on-demand component:
1. When the user loads the dashboard, it reports on the status and details of the system.

STATUS LOOP (every 60 seconds)
---

### 1) Volttron driver polls sensors and fan
A customized volttron driver reads each sensor and the fan state. It validates and publishes these to the message bus.
 
### 2) WatchDog runs  
Our customized WatchDog agent checks various system pieces:
- that sensors report in and that their values are reasonable
- that the fan state reports in
- that all required Volttron agents are running
- that the MariaDB database is operating
- that Volttron can access the Internet
    
WatchDog writes any failed checks to the log, sends an alert to the cloud, and publishes its results to the message bus.
    
### 3) StatusHistorian records sensor data and fan state 
Our customized StatusHistorian records the following in the database:
    - the current values of sensors and fan state (data is overwritten after 24 hours)
    - any errors reported by WatchDog 

---
SAMPLING LOOP (every 5 minutes, i.e. 300 seconds)
---
### 1) Volttron driver polls sensors and fan
As part of its 60 second routine, volttron reads sensor and the fan state, publishing these to the message bus.

### 2) SamplingHistorian records sensor data and fan state 
Our customized SamplingHistorian records sensor data and fan state to the database. This data is permanent and used for analysis.

>TODO: Should we keep all of this data on the local database? or should we keep a set amount locally and send all of it to the cloud?

>For Historian topic syntax, see http://volttron.readthedocs.io/en/releases-4.1/core_services/historians/Historian-Topic-Syntax.html 

---
DECISION LOOP (every 10 minutes)
---

>NOTE: An alternative... a "gauge" agent for each device.
 The gauge would model and continuously update the device's state.
 Gauge's would hold data for a certain sampling period, then send it to storage.
 A gauge could expose methods like averageMean(), min(), max(), etc.
 Gauge's could link drivers to higher level components, flattening the levels of code.
 For example, the FanDecisionLogic could simply call each gauge, removing the "DataAggregator".
 Likewise, the dashboard could send remote requests to the gauges for real time status. 


### 1) DataAggregator retrieves and publishes relevant data
DataAggregator fetches sensor data, the fan state, and any other relevant data into a collection. It publishes this to the message bus.
 
### 2) FanDecisionLogic begins
FanDecisionLogic retrieves the aggregated data and begins a chain sequence. First it calls an RPC on FacilityModel.

### 3) FacilityModel updates model
Our customized FacilityModel agent combines sensor and fan data, analyzes them, and reaches a decision about the fan. It returns this decision to FanDecisionLogic.

### 4) FanDecisionLogic decides what command to send to the fan
FanDecisionLogic uses the FacilityModel results to determine if the fan state should change or remain the same. If a change is needed, it calls the FanController via RPC. It reports on its decision to the message bus.

### 5) If called, FanController processes the command
Our customized FanController is a wrapper around Volttron's ActuatorAgent. It can start or stop the fan. It reports on its action to the message bus.

### 8) DecisionHistorian records the model's decision. 
DecisionHistorian records the decision of FanDecisionLogic and the results of FanController to the database.

ACCESSORY DATA LOOP (every 60 minutes)
---


---
LOCAL DASHBOARD (on demand)
---

### 1) Dashboard reads and reports status.
Whenever a user loads the dashboard page, the dashboard fetches data from the system. 

Data is divided into three bins: Current, Last 24 hours, and Historical. If the dashboard page is open, it will update the current data every 90 seconds. Data for the last 24 hours updates every 30 minutes.

 
---
REMOTE DASHBOARD (on demand)
--- 

### 1) Local MySQL Master replicates to Cloud Slave
With a small delay, the local mysql stream replicates its contents to a remote slave database hosted on a VPS.

### 2) Remote Dashboard reads and report status. 
The remote dashboard is identical to the local one, except it uses the remote slave database as its data source.
